1. What is benchmarking?
Benchmarking refers to testing and analysis of softwares/systems performance.

2. Why is benchmarking important?
Benchmarking tells whether system is working correctly within the environment or if there is something wrong.

3. How would you represent the results described in this comic strip?

4. The article by Gernot Heiser mentions another research article on the incorrect usage of arithmetic mean. The following contains a set of tables from that article. Assuming that E, F, .. K are different benchmarks and R, M, and Z are different processors. What can you infer from Table 1 and Table 2?
In table 1 the differences in means are quite neglitable and doesn't offer clear cut solution, which processor is better. In table 2 differences in arithmetic means are
much greater and choosing the better processor is much easier. But the measurements of different benchmarks don't change between tables. It is easy to portray something
as better if normalized differently.

5. How would you use the data in Table 1 and Table 2 to compare the performance of the processors
Infering only from numbers is quite hard and in most cases not wanted.

If there is a way to put a weight on different benchmarks, I would calculate a weighted average.
If for example we know that procesor that is chosen peforms mostly task that benchmark H measures, I would put more weight on that performance.
