# Serverless - Heikki Pulli

## 1

Serverless has many definitions because of the different ways to look into it. It is a term meaning of hiding the server management from app developers and therefore it also means of thinking apps just as functions that provide something valuabloe. To me all computations are serverless as long as only thing I need to know is how much does it cost to run my app on providers platform and that I dont need to pay from the time nobody is using my app.

Probably Faas (Function-as-a-service) because to me apps are not just some functions that do stuff. Apps consists of multiple different functionalities that are managed to work together. These single functionalities can be abstracted into functions, but alone they don't consist of working app.

Faas is a single function that provides something to the application that is using it. Usually these are running to VMs or containers and deployed to the environment where they can be accessed, ie. cluster. Baas (Backend-as-a-service) is a more broad concept of functionality that applications can use. Baas can include databases, pub-sub queus and many other higher level functionalities. The main point is that developers don't need to set these up themselves but can just use the platform providers own solution. These relate to my definition neatly, because developers don't need to know how they work, but just need to know how much it costs to use these solutions.

"Scale to zero" means that when no one is using your application there is no need and sense to keep it running in the server. This also means that developers are not charged of the usage of the server when it is not running on the server. When someone requests the service via HTTP -request for example, then it is started again in the server.
