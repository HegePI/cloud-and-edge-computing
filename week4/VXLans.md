Todays datacenters and cloud providers are testing the limits of the STP protocol. Datacenter networks use VLAN to provide broadcast isolation, where every stp port provides an isolated VLAN. But STP can only provide 4094 of these and that is too few for modern datacenters. The need for more isolated VLAN has grown due to increase in VM technologies.
